# pyrenew-flu-light

⚠️ This is a work in progress.

_`pyrenew-flu-light` is an influenza forecasting model (originally written in `R`, using the package [Epidemia](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/epidemia/), with the name `cfaepim`) that has been re-instantiated via [PyRenew](https://github.com/CDCgov/PyRenew)._

NOTE: Presently, this `pyrenew-flu-light` cannot be installed and used with current NHSN data.

## Usage

PFL (`pyrenew-flu-light`) can be used in two modes: "active" and "historical". The "active" mode uses respiratory incidence data sourced from available API frameworks whereas the "historical" mode relies on saved dataset snapshots (currently, these snapshots are from the 2023-24 NHSN data, and were generated by `cfaepim` code).

Before running PFL, installing `poetry` and creating a virtual environment will very likely be necessary. This can be first done via `pipx install poetry` (see [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) website for more information) and then, to create the environment, `poetry install` followed by `poetry shell` in the PFL folder (only done after cloning: `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/pyrenew-flu-light`).

After `poetry shell` has been run, then to use the "historical" mode (once within the folder `pyrenew_flu_light`), the `run.py` file creates an _experiment_. Each experiment generates forecasts based on selected jurisdictions and a configuration file. The configuration files for the "historical" mode are derived from the configuration files used in `cfaepim`; the reader will most often never need to worry about configuration files in the "historical" mode. To run:

```
poetry run python run.py --reporting_date 2024-01-20 --regions NY,AL,CA --historical --forecast --exp_name experiment_01

poetry run python run.py --reporting_date 2024-03-30 --regions not:NY,AL,CA --historical --forecast --exp_name experiment_02
```
