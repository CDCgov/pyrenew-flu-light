    Receive numpyro samples taken from a posterior

    draws.

    Parameters
    ----------
    post_p_fs
        Posterior predictive samples for the reference date.
    variable_name
        Which variable in the posterior predictive samples
        to convert to dated draws.
    dataset
        The full dataset used for forecasting, including the
        padded pre- and post-observation periods.
    forecast_days
        The number of days for which hospitalizations
        were forecasted.
    reporting_date
        The date in YYYY-MM-DD format for which the forecasts
        have been made.

        Dated draws for the variable of interest.
